   * Since version 1.10.1. To handle messages, Tarantool allocates fibers.
   * To prevent fiber overhead from affecting the whole system, Tarantool restricts how many messages the fibers handle,
   * so that some pending requests are blocked.
   *
   * On powerful systems, increase `net_msg_max` and the scheduler will immediately start processing pending requests.
   *
   * On weaker systems, decrease `net_msg_max` and the overhead may decrease although this may take some time
   * because the scheduler must wait until already-running requests finish.
   *
   * When `net_msg_max` is reached, Tarantool suspends processing of incoming packages until it has processed earlier messages.
   * This is not a direct restriction of the number of fibers that handle network messages,
   * rather it is a system-wide restriction of channel bandwidth.
   * This in turn causes restriction of the number of incoming network messages that the transaction processor thread handles,
   * and therefore indirectly affects the fibers that handle network messages.
   * (The number of fibers is smaller than the number of messages because messages can be released as soon as they are delivered,
   * while incoming requests might not be processed until some time after delivery.)

   * On typical systems, the default value (768) is correct.

   * The rule of thumb is to make sure the buffer can contain at least a few dozen requests.
   * Therefore, if a typical tuple in a request is large, e.g. a few kilobytes or even megabytes,
